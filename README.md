# gptj8bitinstallerscript

start the installing with 0gptj-installer.bat

that will (should) automate everything up to the point where you can run start.bat which will generate text based off of the delandzombie.txt file

i'll fancy up this readme... later...

the code is commented well enough for now but is untested
